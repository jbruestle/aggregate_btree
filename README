This project is an aggregate btee implementation.  
It is copyrighted by Jeremy Bruestle (2012), and is being released under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3.

It consists of two parts, a c++ abtree library, and a set of python wrappers

To build and install the c++ library, do the following:

autoreconf -fi
mkdir build && cd build
../configure
make
sudo make install
cd ..

To build the python bindings, first build and install the c++ libs, followed by
cd python
python2.7 ./setup.py build_ext
python2.7 ./setup.py install

If you are using macports like me, the proper configure line is:

CXXFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib ../configure

and the proper pythong build_ext line is:

python2.7 ./setup.py build_ext -I /opt/local/include -L /opt/local/lib
