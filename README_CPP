The c++ version of the aggregate btree library requires boost

To build and install the c++ library, do the following:

autoreconf -fi
mkdir build && cd build
../configure
make
sudo make install

The libary makes the aggregate btree look like an STL collection with some extra behaviors.  These is currently no documentation, but please see the examples in test/*.cpp for a rough idea of the usage.
